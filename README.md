## About Me
Hey, I'm AJ. I am an undergraduate applied mathematician at The University of New Mexico who programs for the love of it.

You may notice that I have some empty projects. I am currently on a detour into home servers to host my projects on, as they are quite compilation intensive and hardware/OS-specific, and I must complete its deployment before adding new updates to GitHub. I look forward to updating the repositories with new code as soon as possible.
